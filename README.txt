2)main.cpp
MonoStack.h
SpeakerView.h
SpeakerView.cpp

3)N/A

4)Got advice from Ewan Shen when it came to adding stacks to an array to therefore interate through that array later
   Ewan Shen also assisted with the printing of the final printing
   Finally, Ewan Shen helped with the main cpp set up (argc, argv)
   Michael Smith gave advice to use stringstream, seekg to reset inFile position, and finally for loop formatting
   MonoStack.h was primarily the template from class (Dr.Stevens class)

5) g++ -o main *.cpp
./main "input file"
